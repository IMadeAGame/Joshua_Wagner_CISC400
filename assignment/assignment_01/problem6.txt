First, find the radius of the first x and y values and using the formula radius = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
Next, go to the second x and y values and use the equation above to find the radius
Compare the two radius and if they are the same, keep going through the loop, if they are not the same, return false
Repeat these steps until all radius are confirmed to be equal
